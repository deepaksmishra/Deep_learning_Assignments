        "Ans: Neural networks are the core of deep learning, a field that has practical applications in many different areas. Today neural networks are used for image classification, speech recognition, object detection, etc. Now, Let’s try to understand the basic unit behind all these states of art techniques.\n",
        "A single neuron transforms given input into some output. Depending on the given input and weights assigned to each input, decide whether the neuron fired or not. Let’s assume the neuron has 3 input connections and one output.\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "Apart from the fact mentioned above, that the size of the layers represents the network complexity, there is also an aspect of representation quality.\n",
        "In a few papers higher-dimensional representation were used to make the learning problem easier. Can provide you some references if you are interested.\n",
        "For example, one can use Sparse Autoencoder with middle layer having more nodes than input later to achieve sparse representation: this representation would contain more numbers, but most of them would be zeros. It is computationally efficient and great for interpretability.\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "Let ar,ac be the number of rows and columns in A. Similarly, let br, bc be the number of rows and columns in B. Then in order to carry out matrix multiplication it is necessary that ac == br. Why? Well, as you saw in excel we multiplied rows and columns element wise and then added the intermediate products to get the final result. If there is mismatch in dimensions, and one vector is longer than the other, we can no longer carry out element wise multiplication!\n",

        "a + b\n",
        "array([5, 6, 7])\n",
        "Broadcasting allows these types of binary operations to be performed on arrays of different sizes–for example, we can just as easily add a scalar (think of it as a zero-dimensional array) to an array:\n",
        "\n",
        "a + 5\n",
        "array([5, 6, 7])\n",
        "We can think of this as an operation that stretches or duplicates the value 5 into the array [5, 5, 5], and adds the results. The advantage of NumPy's broadcasting is that this duplication of values does not actually take place, but it is a useful mental model as we think about broadcasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can similarly extend this to arrays of higher dimension. Observe the result when we add a one-dimensional array to a two-dimensional array:\n",

        "Ans: \n",
        "Information function. We have a need for information to satisfy curiosity, reduce uncertainty, and better understand how we fit into the world. The amount and availability of information is now overwhelming compared to forty years ago when a few television networks, local radio stations, and newspapers competed to keep us informed. The media saturation has led to increased competition to provide information, which creates the potential for news media outlets, for example, to report information prematurely, inaccurately, or partially.\n",
        "Interpretation function. Media outlets interpret messages in more or less explicit and ethical ways. Newspaper editorials have long been explicit interpretations of current events, and now cable television and radio personalities offer social, cultural, and political commentary that is full of subjective interpretations. Although some of them operate in ethical gray areas because they use formats that make them seem like traditional news programs, most are open about their motives.\n",
        "Instructive function. Some media outlets exist to cultivate knowledge by teaching instead of just relaying information. Major news networks like CNN and BBC primarily serve the information function, while cable news networks like Fox News and MSNBC serve a mixture of informational and interpretation functions. The in-depth coverage on National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, and the more dramatized but still educational content of the History Channel, the National Geographic Channel, and the Discovery Channel, serve more instructive functions.\n",
        "Bonding function. Media outlets can bring people closer together, which serves the bonding function. For example, people who share common values and interests can gather on online forums, and masses of people can be brought together while watching coverage of a tragic event like 9/11 or a deadly tornado outbreak.\n",
        "Diversion function. We all use the media to escape our day-to-day lives, to distract us from our upcoming exam, or to help us relax. When we are being distracted, amused, or relaxed, the media is performing the diversion function.\n"
